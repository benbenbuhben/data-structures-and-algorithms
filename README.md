## Challenege 3 - Binary Search

### Short summary or background information
This is a function called ```binarySearch``` that finds the position of a targeted value in a sorted array.

### Challenge
Write a function called ```binarySearch``` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenege 6 - Linked List Insertions

### Challenge
Assuming you have access to the Node class and all the properties of the Linked List class, write the following methods for the Linked List class:

```.append(value)``` which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
```.insertBefore(value, newVal)``` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
```.insertAfter(value, newVal)``` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
