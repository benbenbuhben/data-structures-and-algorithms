## Challenge 3 - Binary Search

### Short summary or background information
This is a function called ```binarySearch``` that finds the position of a targeted value in a sorted array.

### Challenge
Write a function called ```binarySearch``` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Challenge
Write a function called ```largestProduct``` which takes in a 2D array. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.

### Solution

## Challenge 6 - Linked List Insertions

### Challenge
Assuming you have access to the Node class and all the properties of the Linked List class, write the following methods for the Linked List class:

```.append(value)``` which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
```.insertBefore(value, newVal)``` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
```.insertAfter(value, newVal)``` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Challenge 9 - Linked List Detect Loop

### Challenge
Write a method on the LinkedList class called hasLoop() that takes in no input and returns a boolean indicating whether the Linked List has a loop.

### Solution

# Challenge FIFO Animal Shelter

## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. Implement the following methods:
  - enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
  - dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref, a string, is ‘cat’ return the longest-waiting cat. If pref is ‘dog’, return the longest-waiting dog. For anything else, return either a cat or a dog.

# Challenge Multibracket Validation

## Challenge
Write a function that takes a string as its only argument, and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

### Solution

# Challenge Towers of Hanoi

## Challenge
The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes.
The puzzle starts with the disks sorted (i.e. smaller disks sits on top of larger disks) on the left-most tower, and the objective of the puzzle is to move the disks to the right-most tower with the following restrictions:
Only one disk can be moved at a given time.
A disk is moved from the top of a tower to the top of another tower.
A disk can’t be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Solution

# Challenge FizzBuzzTree

## Challenge
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with it’s news values.
