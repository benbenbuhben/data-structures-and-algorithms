## Challenge 2 - Insert and Shift Array

### Challenge
Write a function called ```insertShiftArray``` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge 3 - Binary Search

### Short summary or background information
This is a function called ```binarySearch``` that finds the position of a targeted value in a sorted array.

### Challenge
Write a function called ```binarySearch``` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge 4 - Adjacent Product

### Challenge
Write a function called ```largestProduct``` which takes in a 2D array. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.

### Solution
*[Solution](https://github.com/benbenbuhben/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/lib/array_data_structures/array_binary_search.js/#L1)*

## Challenge 6 - Linked List Insertions

### Challenge
Assuming you have access to the Node class and all the properties of the Linked List class, write the following methods for the Linked List class:

```.append(value)``` which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
```.insertBefore(value, newVal)``` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
```.insertAfter(value, newVal)``` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Challenge 7 - Linked List kth From End

### Challenge
Assuming you have access to the Node class and all the properties of the Linked List class, write a method that takes a number, k, as input and returns the kth node from the end of the list.

## Challenge 8 - Linked List Merge

### Challenge
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments and returns a linked list with nodes corresponding to the 2 input lists' nodes interleaved.

### Solution
*[Solution](https://github.com/benbenbuhben/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/lib/ll_data_structures/ll_merge_list.js/#L1)*

## Challenge 9 - Linked List Detect Loop

### Challenge
Write a method on the LinkedList class called hasLoop() that takes in no input and returns a boolean indicating whether the Linked List has a loop.

### Solution
*[Solution](https://github.com/benbenbuhben/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/lib/ll_data_structures/ll_detect_loop.js/#L1)*

# Challenge 11 Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Put featureTasks here once you get the promise thing down.

### Solution

# Challenge (insert challenge #) Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. Implement the following methods:
  - enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
  - dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref, a string, is ‘cat’ return the longest-waiting cat. If pref is ‘dog’, return the longest-waiting dog. For anything else, return either a cat or a dog.
